## Key Differences from Original HTML Version

### React-Specific Changes:
1. **Component Structure**: Broken down into reusable React components
2. **State Management**: Uses React hooks (useState, useEffect) for state management
3. **Event Handling**: React synthetic events instead of vanilla JavaScript event listeners
4. **Data Management**: Centralized data in `appData.js` instead of inline JavaScript objects
5. **Custom Hooks**: `useScrollToSection` hook for reusable scroll functionality

### Preserved Features:
1. **Visual Design**: Identical CSS styling maintained
2. **Responsive Layout**: All responsive breakpoints preserved
3. **Animations**: All CSS animations and transitions maintained
4. **Interactive Elements**: Same user interactions and behaviors
5. **Form Functionality**: Contact form with same validation and UX

## Styling

The original CSS has been preserved in `src/styles/App.css` with all:
- CSS Custom Properties (CSS Variables)
- Responsive design breakpoints
- Animations and transitions
- Component-specific styling
- Dark mode support

## Data Structure

All application data is centralized in `src/data/appData.js` including:
- Company information

- Testimonials
- Work process steps

## Browser Support
